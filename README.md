## Whale of Portfolio

My name is Oscar Lopez, a student at the University of Miami FinTech Bootcamp class. 

In this activity, I was task with analyzing different portfolios using quantitative techniques within Python and Pandas based on the historical daily return data of each portfolio to determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios. I needed to create a custom stocks portfolio as well to compare it to the existing portfolios performances, calculate standard deviation, rolling statistics, correlations and plotting in different time periods for all portfolios.

In this assignment, I felt challenged in different areas when applying Pandas functions and attributes. specially while using google sheets to create a custom portfolio.
