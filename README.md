## Whale_of_Portfolio

My name is Oscar Lopez, a student at the University of Miami FinTech Bootcamp class. In this activity, I was task with anilysing diffrent portfolios using quantitive techniques within Python and Pandas based on the historical dayly return data of each portfolio to determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios. I needed to create a custum stocks portfilio as well to compare it to the existing portfolios performances, calculate standard diviations, rolling statistics, correlations and plotting in different time periods for all portfolios.


In this assigment I felt challenged in different areas when applying Pandas functions and attributes. specially while using google sheets to create a custum protfolio.
